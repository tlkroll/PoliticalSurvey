<h1>AI Political Survey</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This application has two main parts - a survey which collects data and a game which guesses the user's political party affiliation in as few questions as possible. The survey portion asks the user 10 political questions and then asks with which political party they most closely align. This data is then used to update a file which records the probability of each party to answer individual questions a certain way. The party guessing game makes use of this historical data by updating party affiliation probability with each question answered and returns a guess when the probability threshold is reached.
